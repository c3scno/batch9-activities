/* Coding Challenge #1:
We need to write a function that will allow us to count books each time we get a new one in a delivery.
What variable would you assign the variable `bookCount` in the situation below.
Please replace the ** to make the function work.

** bookCount = 0

function increment(){
    bookCount +=1
}
increment() */

let bookCount = 0

function increment(){
    bookCount +=1
}
increment()

/* We have just sold 3 books and got 3 new ones!
What would you have to do here to the `books` variable for the function to work so it would replace the current books array with our 3 new ones?
Please make the function work.

const books = ['Moby Dick', 'Alice in Wonderland', 'Hungry Caterpillar']

function replaceBooks(){
    books = ['Life of Pi', 'Grokkings Algorithms', 'New Earth']
}
replaceBooks() */

/* We need to text our customer that their book is in. What would you have to do here in order for this function to work?

function textCustomer() {
    {
       let firstName = 'Molly' 
    }
    console.log('Hi ' + firstName + ', your book is now in')
}
textCustomer() */

/*     Coding Challenge: Objects
Create an object that describes something of your choosing, like a car or animal.
Give that object 5 key/value pairs that include all primitive and complex data types
Give the object 1 method that uses the 'this' keyword to console log something from the object when called
console.log 2 properties from the object, once with 'dot' notation and once with 'bracket' notation. */

/* Add another object to the start of our gardenPlants array using the unshift method:

let gardenPlants = [ 
    {
        name: 'roses', 
        origin: 'China'
    },
    {
        name: 'tulips', 
        origin: 'Asia'
    },
] */

/* Coding Challenge
Declare a variable username - stored as a string.
Declare a variable password - stored as a string.
Write an if-else statement,
if the username is incorrect, log incorrect
if the password is incorrect, log incorrect
else - both were correct and the user was able to log in */

/* Create an if-else statement that logs if the object property is true or false
